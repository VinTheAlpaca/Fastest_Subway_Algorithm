# Fastest_Subway_Algorithm

This project will introduce a beta version of decision supporting system for customers to use in subway stations in order to find their way. The program was constructed on three spreadsheets which have functions of presenting the general information, calculating the shortest path and holding the data. The main algorithms for finding the shortest path and drawing the instruction map were implemented in VBA. In this report, it will firstly describe the data preparation and algorithm that has been used to give a general knowledge about the project. After that, an example solution will be mentioned for explanation purpose. Then, the detailed instructions about how to use its function and the three spreadsheets will be demonstrated in detail. Finally, it will extend to a little further to the potential limitations and assumption of the spreadsheet in real-time setting.
