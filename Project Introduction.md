# The Fastest Way to Take Subway

### Project Description

The project is based on VBA. Its purpose is to design a subway ride path recommendation system. We need to design the fastest subway ride path algorithm based on the shortest path algorithm in the simulated subway system (a total of 3 lines and 5 stations), and implement the algorithm through VBA. The algorithm can provide the fastest route for passengers arriving at any station at any time, so that they can get to the target station quickly.

### Project Duty
My responsibilities in the project include,
1. Realizing the fastest path algorithm based on the shortest path algorithm in VBA.
2. A simple visual route recommendation map and interactive interface are realized in Excel.
3. Write project documents and system manuals.

### Project achievements

Through Excel and VBA to realize the shortest path algorithm of subway ride, and make a preliminary system prototype.
